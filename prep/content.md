    * Telescopes
      *  Telescopes are devices that magnify objects far away.

     * CMOS Adapters
        * A mechanical or optical interface that connects a CMOS-based scientific camera to a telescope or other astronomical instrument.
     * CMOS Sensors
        * A device that captures faint light from distant stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects. These sensors record the data gathered from a telescope and convert it into an usable format (like an image or video).

* [Astrophysics Division Technology](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/programs/astrophysics-division-technology/)
    * After reading this page I didn't understand much of what it was talking about, but I clicked on a link that led me to a different website where you could find technology used in Astrophysics.
      * [Astrophysics Technology Development](https://esto.nasa.gov/Astrophysics/)
        * In this website I could find tons of techology, mainly telescopes and their parts.
         * Detectors are devices that capture different wavelengths of light into a telescope. In this website I found detectors like Far IR, UVOIR, and UV, that capture Infra-red, Ultra-violet, and visible light from outer space into telescopes to convert them into electric signals that can be processed and analyzed by a computer.
         * Lenses are a curved piece of glass, or plastic that refract light to magnify an image, These are mainly used in small refracting telescopes, and in camera lenses.

     * Photometers
     * Bolometers

### Programming Languages

 * https://astrobites.org/guides/guide-to-astrophysical-software/
    * Python, IDL, C/C++, and MATLAB are just a couple of the languages that help Astrophysicist search the Universe.
  * https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/ResearchFacilities/software-for-astrophyiscs This website has many softwares so I would recommend you to bookmark it if you're interested.

### Software
[Guide to Astrophysical Software](https://astrobites.org/guides/guide-to-astrophysical-software/) (go to the bottom of the page)
### Spacecrafts



  *  https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/topic/detector-technology.
    * The Parker Solar Probe is a spacecraft designed to fly in the Sun's outer atmosphere. The spacecraft is part of the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) instrument suite, which takes electrically-charged particles directly from our Sun's atmosphere for study.


### Others

   * serial devices
         * They are devices that communicate with computers or a telescope control system by sending data ,one bit at a time.
         * They are used for imaging, telescope control, or environmental monitoring.
