* First seach: *technology in Astrophysics*.
  * https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/programs/astrophysics-division-technology/
    * After reading this page I didn't understand much of what it was talking about, but I clicked on a link that led me to a different website where you could find technology used in Astrophysics.
      * https://esto.nasa.gov/Astrophysics/
        * In this website I could find tons of techology, mainly telescopes and their parts.
         * Detectors are devices that capture different wavelengths of light into a telescope. In this website I found detectors like Far IR, UVOIR, and UV, that capture Infra-red, Ultra-violet, and visible light from outer space into telescopes to convert them into electric signals that can be processed and analyzed by a computer.
         * Lenses are a curved piece of glass, or plastic that refract light to magnify an image ___ These are mainly used in refracting telescopes.
