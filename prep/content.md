* First seach: *technology in Astrophysics*.
  * https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/programs/astrophysics-division-technology/
    * After reading this page I didn't understand much of what it was talking about, but I clicked on a link that led me to a different website where you could find technology used in Astrophysics.
      * https://esto.nasa.gov/Astrophysics/
        * In this website I could find tons of techology, mainly telescopes and their parts.
         * Detectors are devices that capture different wavelengths of light into a telescope. In this website I found detectors like Far IR, UVOIR, and UV, that capture Infra-red, Ultra-violet, and visible light from outer space into telescopes to convert them into electric signals that can be processed and analyzed by a computer.
         * Lenses are a curved piece of glass, or plastic that refract light to magnify an image, These are mainly used in small refracting telescopes, and in camera lenses.

    * The Parker Solar Probe is a spacecraft designed to fly in the Sun's outer atmosphere. The spacecraft is part of the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) instrument suite, which takes electrically-charged particles directly from our Sun's atmosphere for study.

## Explicitely Hardware

* First seacrh: Astrophysics hardware.

    * Telescopes
     *  Telescopes are devices that magnify objects far away.
    * Spectrometers
     * Spectrometers are devices that measure the physical characteristics of objects by detecting light that's reflecting off an object and dividing it into its component wavelenghts (like when light goes through a prism).
   
 * Second search: Astrophysics gadgets
   * https://www.astro-physics.com/cmos-adapters/
     * CMOS Adapters
       * A CMOS adapter is a mechanical or optical interface that connects a CMOS-based scientific camera to a telescope or other astronomical instrument.

      * serial devices
         * They are devices that communicate with computers or a telescope control system by sending data ,one bit at a time.
         * They are used for imaging, telescope control, or environmental monitoring.
