# Entry 3 Brainstorming the Problem
##### 1/12/25


## Brainstorming part B
Part B of my project will be about future inventions that don't exist yet. As I ruminated on this I thought about several inventions that appeared fascinating to me. Even though I didn't put much effort, or time into brainstorming these ideas, I think that they are sufficient, at least for now. Later on I plan in adding onto these ideas so that I have more content for my website.
