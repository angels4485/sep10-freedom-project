# Entry 3 Brainstorming the Problem
##### 1/12/25


## Brainstorming part B
Part B of my project will be about future inventions that don't exist yet. As I ruminated on this I thought about several inventions that appeared fascinating to me. Despite of the fact that I didn't put much effort, or time into brainstorming these ideas, I think that they are sufficient, at least for now, and later on I plan in adding onto these ideas so that I have more content for my website.


## Future Inventions
I tried to imagine technology that could be not only useful for exploring space, but also that could be useful in different areas, not just Astrophysics or Astronomy.

For instance, one invention I thought about was a device that absorbs gravitational potential energy. This device would literally absorb the "change" in space-time, which sounds incredible. Imagine a device that could absorb gravitational potential energy and turn it into electrical energy or some other type of energy. Another example could be a device that could re-use its energy. To me, that is fascinating.


This device would have to find a way of converting the energy lost as heat back into electrical energy, or a type of fuel.
At first this device could be massive, but then with time and as our engineering knowledge increases we might be able to shrink it down to the size of a space telescope.
A device that could exist in impossible physics, such as in a black hole.
This is mostly hypothetical because we don’t even know how physics works inside something like a black hole, but maybe this device could resist the gravity of the black hole (potentially using a device that absorbs gravitational potential energy).
A device that could transform energy so fast that extreme heat wouldn’t affect it.

This device could endure extreme temperatures such as the ones in the center of stars
