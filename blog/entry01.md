# Entry 1: Choosing my topic (Astrophysics)
##### 10/10/25

The first thing that came to my mind for the freedom project was physics. It's my favorite subject by far, and I love learning about many topics such as waves, gravity, and electrostatic force. As I was researching the topics that interested me I discovered that there's one that conbines physics with another one of my favorite things, astronomy. Even though I chose astrophysics as my main interest, I'm still looking forward to learning from other areas such as data science and informatics, so maybe in the future I'll do internships for all of these and do research about them. Some pages I used to make research about these are
