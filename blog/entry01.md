## Reasearch on Astrophysics and similar areas
The first thing that came to my mind for the freedom project was physics. It's my favorite subject by far, and I love learning about many topics such as waves, gravity, and just most things related to how things work. As I was researching the topics that interested me I discovered that there's one area that conbines physics with one of my favorite things, astronomy. Even though I chose astrophysics as my main interest, I'm still looking forward to learning from other areas such as data science and informatics, so maybe in the future I'll do internships for all of these and do research about them.

Some pages I used to make research about astrophysics are
[Careers in astrophysics - School of Mathematics and Physics](https://smp.uq.edu.au/research/astrophysics/study/careers-astrophysics)
by the University of Queensland, in Australia, and [Analysis: How AI is helping astronomers study the universe | PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/analysis-how-ai-is-helping-astronomers-study-the-universe) In these websites I really could see how it would be like to be an astrophysicist, which only made me even more thrilled to become one, and one way technology is used in this area (AI). Some other websites I used to reasearch were [To boldly know what no one has known before ](https://attheu.utah.edu/facultystaff/to-boldly-know-what-no-one-has-known-before/), [What are some of the issues astronomers face when trying to use ground-based telescopes? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-issues-astronomers-face-when-trying-to-use-ground-based-telescopes), in this two articles I could see how it would be to be and astronomer and also the kind of stuff that they do and see. I was also able to see some of the challenges that they go through which made me curious about inventing new technologies that would help astronomers overcome these challenges more easily. Then for my third topic, Astroinformatics, I read[Exploring Astroinformatics: Bridging Astronomy and Data Science - David Maiolo](https://www.davidmaiolo.com/2024/02/23/exploring-astroinformatics-bridging-astronomy-data-science/) and [Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal
](https://asaip.psu.edu/astroinformatics-in-a-nutshell/#:~:text=Astroinformatics%20enables%20data%20integration%2C%20data%20mining%2C%20information,search%20and%20discovery%20tools%20*%20Visualization%20environmentsastroinformatics-in-a-nutshell/#:~:text=Astroinformatics%20enables%20data%20integration%2C%20data%20mining%2C%20information,search%20and%20discovery%20tools%20*%20Visualization%20environments). both of these sites have a lot of information about Astroinformatics, what it is and what Astroinformatics do, which helped me understand better what it is.

## EDP
My step #1 was basically finding what I wanted to do, wether it was physics, astronomy, data science, astroinformatics or anything else that might interest me. I had to do a lot of research, I mainly searched up how jobs in these areas would be but at the end I arrived at Astrophysics. I did a bit of researching in how technology is being used in that field and I found out that of course, they use telescopes to observe the sky, but they also use AI which helps Astrophyscisist interpret what they are looking at in telescopes, make images more detailed, and process more information faster.

## Skills
After doing all this research and typing this blog I've gained a few skills. First of all, I learned that I should _plan out_ what I'm going to do before I do so, and also that I need to _see how much work a task is gonna take_, specially if I'm going to leave it for later. When I started doing this blog I was overwhelmed by the amount of research I had to do and all the typing too, and so I thought that maybe I wasn't going to be able to do it in time, but here we are, and so this takes me to my next point. I also learned that even when something seems too much for you to do before a certain due date, you *can* _still_ do it in time without the need to rush everything.
