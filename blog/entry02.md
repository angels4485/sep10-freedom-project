## Researching Software and Hardware

When it comes to software in Astrophysics I had a bit of a hard time finding tech that fitted into this category, until I found [this remarkable website](https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/ResearchFacilities/software-for-astrophyiscs) which provided me with several options for software used in this area. Some of the additional inventions I found had to do with programming languages, and algorithms. As I was researching the hardware I found a couple of interesting inventions that I hadn't heard about. Of course, there's the usual telescopes, but then there is also hardware that allows astrophysicists to figure out what element stars have and detect specific wavelengths of light, there's hardware made for space telescopes, that help cool down these telescopes, devices that convert the data from a telescope into images and, or videos, and more.

### Hardware
One interesting invention I discovered in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_astronomical_instruments) is the spectrometer. A spectrometer is a device that measures the physical characteristics of objects by detecting light that's reflecting off an object and dividing it into its component wavelengths (like when light goes through a prism). 
* In [The Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/topic/detector-technology) I saw another piece of technology that I found noteworthy, The Parker Solar Probe. The Parker Solar probe is a spacecraft that orbits the sun to study its atmosphere. 
* I came across other intriguing inventions in a [website](https://www.astro-physics.com/cmos-adapters/) which selled Astrophysics gadgets, some of these were:
    
    * Serial devices: devices that communicate with computers and telescope control systems.
    * CMOS adapters: mechanical or optical interface that connect a CMOS-based scientific camera to a telescope or other astronomical instruments.
    * CMOS sensors: These are devices that capture faint light from distant stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects. These sensors record the data gathered from a telescope and convert it into an usable format (like an image or video).
 
 ### Software
  For software, thanks to [Cavendish Astrophysics](https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/ResearchFacilities/software-for-astrophyiscs), I was able to find software that seemed compelling to me. Additionally, I found programming languages such as Python, C/C++, Matlab, and IDL; algorithms and even a neural network training code for machine learning.
    
  * BAMBI (Blind Accelerated Multimodal Bayesian Inference) is a Bayesian inference engine that combines the benefits of SkyNet with MultiNest. It's operated by simultaneously performing Bayesian inference using MultiNest and learning the likelihood function using SkyNet
    * SkyNet is an efficient and robust neural network training code for machine learning. It is able to train large and deep feed-forward neural networks, including autoencoders, for use in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning applications, such as regression, classification, density estimation, clustering and dimensionality reduction. 
    * MULTINEST is an efficient Bayesian inference tool for cosmology and particle physics. It calculates the evidence, with an associated error estimate, and produces posterior samples from distributions that may contain multiple modes and pronounced (curving) degeneracies in high dimensions.

## Reflecting on my research and Engineering Design Process (EDP)
  I personally believe that all of these innovations are remarkable and that people should know more about them because they were worked on by a lot of people who put much effort into building them, and also because they are _fascinating_. All these inventions help scientists better understand the Universe and our solar system, which is something that I find significant. While doing this blog I found myself in step two of the EDP, researching the problem, which is that many people don't know enough about the technology used in Astrophysics. I found many inventions that people would probably be interested in if they simply had the chance to learn about them. Now, I think I can move on to step 3, which is brainstorming possible solutions to this problems, may it be creating a website (which is what we will be doing), or even creating youtube videos about these technologies.

## Takeaways
From doing this blog and the research I feel like I gained a lot. *I learned to _really_ google* in a way that helps me find the information that I want, I *learned to use the resources* that I have available to help me complete my work, and I learned how important *planning what information you are going to use* in something like this is.

### Googling
During all this research I had to use the advanced search button in order to find more accurate information and exclude that which I know isn't important. For instance, it happened to me that as I was doing research about Astrophysics hardware Amazon kept showing up, so in order to find the information that I wanted, I typed Amazon in the words I wanted to exclude and I typed that I wanted .org, .edu, or .gov in these websites.

### Use of resources 
As I was typing the blog I kept getting stuck, not knowing what to do. Because of this, I decided to go back and look at things like the rubric, the blog examples, and the Engineering Design process section in the [hstatsep website](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/).
 
### Importance of planning
For this blog I used the research that I had already done and had typed in my content.md. This helped me get the work done without having to do all of the research all over again, without having that much time. As I was finishing my typing I was so thankful that we had done all of this research.
