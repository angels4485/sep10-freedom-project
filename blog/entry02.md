## Researching Software and Hardware

When it comes to software in Astrophysics I had a bit of a hard time finding tech that fitted into this category. Some of what I found had to do with programmig languages and algorithms. As I was researching the hardware I found a couple of interesting inventions that I hadn't heard about. Of course, there's the usual telesopes, but then there is also hardware that allows astrophysicists to figure out what element stars have and detect specific wavelengths of light, there's hardware made for space telescopes, that help cool down these telescopes, devices that convert the data from a telescope into images and, or videos, and more.

### Hardware
* One interesting invention I found is the spectrometer. A spectrometer is a device that measure the physical characteristics of objects by detecting light that's reflecting off an object and dividing it into its component wavelenghts (like when light goes through a prism). 
* Another invention that I really liked was The Parker Solar Probe. The Parker Solar probe is a spacecraft that orbits the sun to study its atmosphere. 
* Some other cool inventions are the serial devices, which are devices that communicate with computers and telescope control systems, CMOS adapters, which are mechanical or optical interface that connect a CMOS-based scientific camera to a telescope or other astronomical instruments, and CMOS sensors. These are devices that capture faint light from distant stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects. These sensors record the data gathered from a telescope and convert it into an usable format (like an image or video).
